Welcome to the Mapty project! This project is a web application that allows users to track and log their workouts, whether they're running or cycling. It utilizes the Leaflet library to display an interactive map where users can add their workouts by clicking on the map. The workouts are then displayed both on the map as markers and in a list on the sidebar.
